<p>I am a Urologic Oncologist and an Assistant Professor of Urology at New York University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My clinical practice focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of cancers of the urinary tract including cancers of the kidney, bladder, and prostate. My research interests are in using machine learning methods to improve health care outcomes. I am the founder of <a href="https://www.urologyschool.com" target="new">UrologySchool.com.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, I was fellow in the Combined Harvard Program in Urologic Oncology and a co-instructor for 6.7930/HST.956 &quot;Machine Learning for Healthcare&quot; at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.  I completed the Surgeon-Scientist Program at the University of Toronto, with a Ph.D. in Clinical Epidemiology and Health Care Research, and medical school at McGill University.</p>
